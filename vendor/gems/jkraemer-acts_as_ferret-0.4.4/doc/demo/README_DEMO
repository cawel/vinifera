Acts_as_Ferret demo project
===========================

This project is intended to run with edge rails which can
be installed with

rake rails:freeze:edge


You'll also need to set up a database for it.
SQL scripts for both SQLite and MySQL are provided in db/ .

Just set up one of these, and configure your db connection 
in config/database.yml .

after that run 
rake
to see the unit tests pass.
