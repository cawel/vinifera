= WillPaginate

Quick quiz: Where does pagination logic belong?

  a) in the model;
  b) in the controller;
  c) in views;
  d) all of the above.

We think you know the answer (if you think hard enough).

This plugin makes magic happen. You *will* paginate!


== Example usage:

Use a paginate finder in the controller:

    @posts = Post.paginate_by_board_id @board.id, :page => params[:page]

Yeah, +paginate+ works just like +find+ -- it just doesn't fetch all the records.
Just don't forget to tell it which page you want!

Render the posts in your view like you would normally do. When you need to render
pagination, just stick this in:

    <%= will_paginate @posts %>

You're done. (Copy and paste the example fancy CSS styles from the bottom.)

How does it know how much items to fetch per page? It asks your model by calling
+Post.per_page+. You can define it like this:

    class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
      cattr_reader :per_page
      @@per_page = 50
    end

... or like this:

    class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
      def self.per_page
        50
      end
    end

... or don't worry about it at all. (WillPaginate defines it to be 30 if missing.)
You can also specify the count explicitly when calling +paginate+:

    @posts = Post.paginate :page => params[:page], :per_page => 50

The +paginate+ finder wraps the original finder and returns your resultset that now has
some new properties. You can use the collection as you would with any ActiveRecord
resultset, but WillPaginate view helpers also need that object to be able to render pagination:

    <ol>
      <% for post in @posts -%>
        <li>Render `post` in some nice way.</li>
      <% end -%>
    </ol>

    <p>Now let's render us some pagination!</p>
    <%= will_paginate @posts %>
